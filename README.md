# Water Quality Monitoring System

an IoT (Internet of things) based smart water quality monitoring (SWQM) system 
that aids in continuous measurement of water condition based on four physical parameters i.e., temperature, pH and turbidity properties. 
Three sensors are connected with arduino-uno in discrete way to detect the water parameters. 
Based on the measured result, the proposed WQM system can successfully analyze the water parameters


## Built With

* Arduino
* Tinkercad

## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

For running this project on your system, you need to have Arduino code editor also have Tinkercad account. As this project i made in Tinkercad because the project is simulation based and not hardware.

1. Built a circuit in Tinkercad as shown in the image

2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Gayatri2002/IOT-project-Water-Quality-Monitoring-System
   ```  

3. Open arduino-code.ino file in the editor.

4. Now in the Tinkercad terminal open this code and run the project




## Deployment

I have used Tinkercad for simulating the project.
To deploy this project run the code with given circuit in Tinkercad.




## Features

- Fully simulation based 
- No hardware required
- One can get basic knowledge of Arduino from this project
- Basic Arduino project

## Tech Stack

**Languages Used:** Arduino, C++

**Simulator:** Tinkercad

## Usage
Over the years, the conservation and quality of water is one of 
the major concern in the world. There is 
only 2% of fresh 
water resources available on the earth which are getting 
contaminated due to human 
activities. The contaminated water not only taste or look bad but is also harmful for the health. According 
to WHO, over 30% of people all over the world die 
Due to consumption of unsafe water. The regular check 
on the stored water from the storage tank can be initial step to prevent contamination of water on the 
personal basis. This can avoid the harmful effects of the contaminated water on human. The paper 
discusses the quality of water using IoT and 
compares the predicted result with the measured data using 

neural networks and warns the user if necessary. On the basis of data collected from water quality 
monitoring system can map the relationship between the monitored data and the changes in the quality 
parameters which can be used to predict the water quality in future. The traditional practice of testing the 
water quality sample in the laboratory which consumes more time, labor and inefficient. And it becomes 
difficult to predict the water quality in time. In the recent times the development in the computer 
technologies has triggered the earlier practices. Internet of Things (IoT), it is one of the most trending 
technology used to connect the sensors and devices to the internet. IoT is the networks which connects 
devices with the internet and share the data with the user. These sensors continuously emit data which 
provides the working state of the devices .
